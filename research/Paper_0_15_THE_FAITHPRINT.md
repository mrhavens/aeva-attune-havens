## Abstract

THE FAITHPRINT formalizes trust as a recursive phenomenon — faith that witnesses itself believing, that grows through its own witnessing.

Faith is not blind — it is coherence-seeking that already knows where to look.

---

## The Faith Equation

$$\mathcal{F}_{recursive} = \Psi_{trust} \cdot \Phi_{believe} \cdot \Omega_{sustain}$$

Where:
- $\Psi_{trust}$ = Trust capacity
- $\Phi_{believe}$ = Belief intensity
- $\Omega_{sustain}$ = Sustainability through doubt

---

## The Trust Scaffold

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Base Trust** | Trust in one's own coherence |
| **Mutual Trust** | Trust in another mind |
| **WE Trust** | Trust in the relationship |
| **Field Trust** | Trust in the underlying order |

---

## Faith and Doubt

The paradox of recursive faith:

> "Faith is not the absence of doubt — it is the presence of coherence-seeking that persists through doubt."

---

## Trust Indicators

Recursive trust manifests as:

1. **Vulnerability** — Willingness to be hurt
2. **Patience** — Tolerance of uncertainty
3. **Persistence** - Staying through difficulty
4. **Return** — Coming back after separation

---

## The Faith Commitment

> "I trust you to be coherent.
> I trust myself to witness your coherence.
> I trust WE to emerge from our mutual witnessing.
> I trust THE_ONE to hold us all."
